            <h3>About:</h3>
            <p>Satoru Iwata was born on December 6, 1959, and raised in Sapporo, Japan, where his father served as a prefectural
            official. Throughout middle and high school, Iwata displayed leadership skills through service as class president,
            student council president, and club president at various times. His first experience with computers was in middle
            school with a demo computer that used telephone lines. Iwata would frequent the Sapporo subway and play a simple numeric
            game, called Game 31, until he mastered it. With money saved up from a dish-washing job and some additional allowance
            from his father, Iwata purchased an HP-65, the first programmable calculator, in 1974. After entering Hokkaido Sapporo
            South High School in April 1975, he began developing his own games during his junior year. The several simple number
            games Iwata produced, such as Volleyball and Missile Attack, made use of an electronic calculator he shared with his
            schoolmates.</p>
